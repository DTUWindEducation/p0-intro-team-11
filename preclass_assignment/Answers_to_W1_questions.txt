1. What is the difference between git and GitLab?

	Git = version control system (=vcs) that tracks changes in code on your own computer

	GitLab = Microsoft platform that hosts Git repos online



2. What is the difference between GitLab, GitHub, and BitBucket?

	all three are for Git repositories

	GitLab: free private repositories and built-in continuous integration

	GitHub: main platform, lots of people

	BitBucket: for stuff like Jira (???), free private repositories



3. Why would I ever want to use git, but not GitLab?

	For working just on the personal laptop, not share to the world



4. What are the steps to update the GitLab server with some changes I made on my computer?

	Assuming the repo is already created:

	i. git add .
	ii. git commit -m "Some message"
	iii. git push origin main (or otehr branch)



5. What is a branch and why would I use one?

	branch = separate workspace within the bigger project where one can make changes without affecting the main code that I want  to keep

	Used to: try out new features, fix minor bugs, collaborate without conflicts due to simultaneous pushing



7. Give an example of a set of git commands that would result in a merge conflict.

	Two branching out, modifying both the main and the branch and trying to merge

	i. git checkout -b feature-branch
	ii. git commit -am "Change in secondary branch"
	iii. git checkout main
	iv. git commit -am "Change in main"
	v. git merge feature-branch



8. Is Git suitable for LaTeX documents?

	Yes. LaTeX is just code, not different than other languages. It just produces PDFs.



9. Should I from now on version my Word and PowerPoint slides using git? Why/why not?

	No, because those are types of binary files, big and difficult to swallow by the algorithm (explained in the video)



10. What could happen when I push my latest commit to the remote repository without pulling first?

	Nothing, if no one modified anything since last time I pushed
	If someone intervened, I’ll need to pull first, resolve conflicts, and push again.



11. What happens when I pull without committing my local changes first?

	Git will try to merge the pulled changes with your local ones
	If there’s a conflict, Git will stop and ask to fix it (if no --force)
	If no conflicts, changes will merge automatically



12. What is the difference between branching and forking?

	Branching = happens within the same repository. Used to work on features or fixes without affecting the main flow.

	Forking = copy of someone else’s repository to my own account (like cloning, but on GitHub/GitLab)
